A small optimization project combining differential evolution with local search.
Differential evolution is a population based evolutionary algorithm capable of global optimization.
We combine it with golden ratio search to achieve local optimization. The aim of this is to achieve faster convergence. 
The program comes with a GUI and three different sample functions to optimize. 
As this is a metaheuristic method it is not guaranteed that the method will always find the optimal solution. 
Especially the Ackley-function is difficult.
